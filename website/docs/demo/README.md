## Local proxy

* to be able to call the Cala server from the browser will need to start a simple nginx proxy.<br />

  Run in the cala repo directory:

  ```
  make run-proxy
  ```
## Try Cala
If both the cala-server and your nginx proxy is running can try the GraphQL functions in the live editor:


* [Journalcreate](./journalcreate.mdx)
