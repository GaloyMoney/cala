The functionality is essential for users (e.g., account holders, financial managers) to view the balance of a specific account in a particular journal and currency. This allows for real-time financial monitoring and decision-making based on up-to-date account information.

## Process

### Variables

- **Account ID**: The `accountId` uniquely identifies the account whose balance is being queried. This ensures that the query is precise and retrieves information for the correct account.
- **Journal ID**: The `journalId` specifies which journal to check for the account's balance. This is important because an account may have different balances in different journals due to various types of transactions.
- **Currency**: The `currency` parameter ensures that the balance is provided in the desired currency, in this case, USD. This is crucial for accuracy and relevance, especially in multi-currency environments.

```
{
  "accountId": "3a7d421b-7f5a-43ca-ba6f-5f3e6ee67237",
  "journalId": "bcc24f47-990c-457d-88cb-76332450ac77",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### GraphQL Request Body

The `accountWithBalance` query is executed with the provided inputs. The query fetches the account's name and its settled balance in the specified journal and currency.

```graphql
query accountWithBalance(
  $accountId: UUID!
  $journalId: UUID!
  $currency: CurrencyCode!
) {
  account(id: $accountId) {
    name
    balance(journalId: $journalId, currency: $currency) {
      settled {
        normalBalance {
          units
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The system retrieves the settled balance from the specified journal for the given account.

## Response

The response includes the account's name and its settled balance in the specified currency and journal. This information is returned in a structured JSON format, which includes:

- **Account Name**: "Alice - Checking", confirming that the balance belongs to the correct account.
- **Settled Balance**: The `normalBalance` `units` show the account's balance as "9.53" USD, indicating the available settled funds in the account.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "name": "Alice - Checking",
      "balance": {
        "settled": {
          "normalBalance": {
            "units": "9.53"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Significance

Checking account balances is a fundamental operation in financial management. It allows users to:

- **Monitor Financial Status**: Users can keep track of their available funds, ensuring they are aware of their financial position.
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Accurate and up-to-date balance information is essential for making financial decisions, such as initiating transactions, budgeting, or investing.
- **Ensure Compliance and Accuracy**: Regularly checking balances helps in identifying any discrepancies or issues early, maintaining the integrity of financial records.
