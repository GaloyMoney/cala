Create different types of accounts (journal, checking, and debit accounts) through the GraphQL API.

## Create a Journal

Initiate the creation of a journal, specifically a "General Ledger," which is fundamental in accounting for keeping track of all the financial transactions of a company.

### Variables

<GraphQLVariables variablesPath="/gql/variables/journalCreate.json" />

The GraphQL mutation request input contains the unique ID and the name of the journal. The system creates a journal entity with these details.

### GraphQL Request Body

<GraphQLBody queryPath="/gql/journal-create.gql" />

### Response

The system returns the details of the newly created journal, including
its ID and name, confirming the successful creation.

<GraphQLResponse responsePath="/gql/responses/journalCreateResponse.json" />

## Create a Checking Account

Next create a checking account named `Alice - Checking`. Checking accounts are typically used for day-to-day banking transactions.

The mutation request includes details like account ID, name, and other attributes like `code` and `normalBalanceType`. <br />
The `normalBalanceType` indicates whether the account is a debit or credit type, essential for correct accounting practices.

### Variables

<GraphQLVariables variablesPath="/gql/variables/accountCreateChecking.json" />

### GraphQL Request Body

<GraphQLBody queryPath="/gql/account-create.gql" />
### Response

The response confirms the creation of the checking account with the specified details, ensuring the account is ready for transactional activities.

<GraphQLResponse responsePath="/gql/responses/accountCreateCheckingResponse.json" />

## Create a Debit Account

Create a debit account labeled `Assets`. Debit accounts are crucial for tracking resources owned by a business.

Similar to the previous account creation, the mutation includes unique identifiers and account-specific information like the `normalBalanceType`, which in this case is `DEBIT`, indicating the nature of transactions expected.

### Variables

<GraphQLVariables variablesPath="/gql/variables/accountCreateDebit.json" />

### GraphQL Request Body

<GraphQLBody queryPath="/gql/account-create.gql" />

### Response

The response shows the successful creation of the debit account, confirming that
it's set up to track asset-related transactions.

<GraphQLResponse responsePath="/gql/responses/accountCreateDebitResponse.json" />
