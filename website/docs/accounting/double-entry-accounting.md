### What is Double-Entry Accounting?
Double-entry accounting is a bookkeeping system that requires every financial transaction to be recorded in at least two accounts: one account will be debited and another will be credited. This system ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) always remains balanced, providing a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.

### How It Works
For each transaction:
- **Debits** must equal **credits**.
- Each transaction affects at least two accounts to keep the equation balanced.
- For example, if a company takes out a loan, it will debit its cash account (an asset) and credit a loans payable account (a liability).

### Importance of Double-Entry Accounting
- **Accuracy**: Reduces errors by ensuring that debits and credits are always balanced.
- **Comprehensive Records**: Provides a complete record of financial transactions, making it easier to track financial performance.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets the standards required by regulatory bodies and provides transparency.
- **Financial Health**: Helps in understanding the financial position of a business by providing detailed information on assets, liabilities, and equity.
